The Samsung SM-A165M is a mid-range device with a MediaTek Helio G99 chipset. On Android 15 (One UI 7), the primary challenge is not the network protocols themselves, but maintaining process persistence against Samsung's aggressive memory management.
1. Persistence Strategy (The "Foreground" Rule)
Android 15 and Samsung's "Chimera" service will kill background processes if they aren't properly declared.
Foreground Service Type: You must use type="connectedDevice" or type="specialUse" in your Manifest to justify long-running SSH/VPN sessions.
Battery Exemptions: Your app must programmatically prompt the user to set the app to "Unrestricted" in Battery settings. Without this, the VPN tunnel will collapse when the device enters "Doze" mode.
2. VPN Implementation (VpnService)
Protocol: Use WireGuard (via the wireguard-android library) rather than OpenVPN. It is more battery-efficient for the Helio G99 and handles 4G signal handovers (switching towers) much better.
Always-On: Implement the VpnService with the SERVICE_INTERFACE intent. The app should guide the user to Settings > Connections > More Connection Settings > VPN to enable the system-level "Always-on" toggle.
Kill Switch: Use VpnService.Builder.setBlocking(true) to prevent any data from leaking outside the tunnel if the connection drops.
3. Terminal Implementation (SSH/Telnet)
Terminal View: Do not reinvent the UI. Use the Termux-view component from the official Termux GitHub. It handles ANSI escape codes and gesture-based scrolling correctly for the A16's 90Hz AMOLED screen.
Secure Storage: Use the Android Keystore System to generate and store your SSH RSA/Ed25519 keys. The SM-A165M has a hardware-backed TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) that prevents keys from being extracted.
